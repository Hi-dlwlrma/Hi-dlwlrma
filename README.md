## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
Iâ€™m currently working at **[YouNet Media](https://www.linkedin.com/company/younet-media/)** as an **AI Engineer**, specializing in **Natural Language Processing** (NLP). I'm deeply fascinated by the intersection of language and technology, and I'm dedicated to exploring how NLP can be leveraged to unlock new insights from vast amounts of text data. Iâ€™m committed to continuously improving my skills, contributing to open source projects, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field of AI.
